# Food-Hub-Python-Project

Context

The number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Lots of students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for them. It provides them with good food from their favorite restaurants. A food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.

The app allows the restaurants to receive a direct online order from a customer. The app assigns a delivery person from the company to pick up the order after it is confirmed by the restaurant. The delivery person then uses the map to reach the restaurant and waits for the food package. Once the food package is handed over to the delivery person, he/she confirms the pick-up in the app and travels to the customer's location to deliver the food. The delivery person confirms the drop-off in the app after delivering the food package to the customer. The customer can rate the order in the app. The food aggregator earns money by collecting a fixed margin of the delivery order from the restaurants.

Objective

The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business. 

Data Description

The data contains the different data related to a food order. The detailed data dictionary is given below.

Data Dictionary

order_id: Unique ID of the order
customer_id: ID of the customer who ordered the food
restaurant_name: Name of the restaurant
cuisine_type: Cuisine ordered by the customer
cost: Cost of the order
day_of_the_week: Indicates whether the order is placed on a weekday or weekend (The weekday is from Monday to Friday and the weekend is Saturday and Sunday)
rating: Rating given by the customer out of 5
food_preparation_time: Time (in minutes) taken by the restaurant to prepare the food. This is calculated by taking the difference between the timestamps of the restaurant's order confirmation and the delivery person's pick-up confirmation.
delivery_time: Time (in minutes) taken by the delivery person to deliver the food package. This is calculated by taking the difference between the timestamps of the delivery person's pick-up confirmation and drop-off information
 

Submission Guidelines

 You have to write the solution code from scratch and only submit a final Jupyter notebook in html format with all the insights and observations.

 

Please follow the below steps to complete the assessment. Please make sure that all the sections mentioned in the rubric have been covered in your submission.

Download the learner notebook.
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to complete the project.

Submit only the solution notebook prepared from the learner notebook [format: .html]
2. Any assignment found copied/plagiarized with other submissions will not be graded and awarded zero marks.

3. Please ensure timely submission as any submission post-deadline will not be accepted for evaluation.

4. Submission will not be evaluated if

it is submitted post-deadline, or,
more than 1 file is submitted.
 Best Practices for submissions

The final notebook should be well-documented, with inline comments explaining the functionality of code and markdown cells containing comments on the observations and insights.
The notebook should be run from start to finish in a sequential manner before submission.
It is important to remove all warnings and errors before submission.
The notebook should be submitted as an HTML file (.html) and NOT as a notebook file (.ipynb).
Please refer to the FAQ page for common project-related queries.
